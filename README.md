# Chicago Data Portal Analysis with SQL and Python
In this assignment, I've worked on a real world dataset provided by the Chicago Data Portal. I was asked questions that would help me understand the data just like a data scientist would. I was assessed both on the correctness of my SQL queries and results.
This assignment involved 3 datasets for the city of Chicago obtained from the Chicago Data Portal:

1. Chicago Socioeconomic Indicators
This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” by Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012.

2. Chicago Public Schools
This dataset shows all school level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year.

3. Chicago Crime Data
This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days.
